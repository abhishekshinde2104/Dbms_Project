# Dbms_Project
This project is made for a fast food supply chain brand named Falahaar, which servers various dishes across different places in Pune and Mumbai.

Throught this website customers could place orders for various food items mentioned in the menu.

Owner of the brand could manage the items to display their prices. Also he could see the sales and make necessary arrangements for the next month early on. In addition to it owner can also keep track of employees who are currently working and also note the salaries paid to them.

With the help of HTML, CSS, Javascript and PHP my group made this project. Where certain usernames have admin access like the owner and the remaining all usernames have customer access.
